Welcome to my Competitive Programming repository.

This is where I store my solutions to problems from various online competitive program platforms that I have worked through.

I primarily use **C++** for problem-solving.

Feel free to use this as a reference or study resource.

## Structure

The repository is organized by platform and/or topic. For example:

```
/codeforces/
/atcoder/
/leetcode/
/templates/
```

Each directory may contain subfolders organized by:

* **Contest name or number** (e.g., `div2_891`)
* **Problem name/code**
* **Topic tags** (optional)

## Topics Covered

This repository includes problems from a variety of topics:

* Data Structures (STL, Segment Trees, Fenwick Trees)
* Graph Algorithms (DFS, BFS, Dijkstra, DSU)
* Dynamic Programming
* Greedy Algorithms
* Math (Number Theory, Combinatorics)
* Strings and Pattern Matching
* Geometry and Bit Manipulation

## Useful Templates

The `templates/` folder contains boilerplate code for common algorithms and data structures:

* Fast I/O
* Union-Find
* Binary Search on Answer
* Modular Arithmetic
* Lazy Segment Tree
* Graph Traversal
